Here is a repository consisting of the most motivational posters I could find on the internet. (Spoiler: they were not found, they were made on Playground AI with Stable Diffusion.)

Questions:
1. Since audio autoplay didn't work for me on the last webpage, how should I rewrite the code to have that work?
2. How can I make text appear right before an image in the body element without the need for so many break tags?
